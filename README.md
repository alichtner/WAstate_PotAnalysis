# WAstate_PotAnalysis
A repository for the analysis of WA state pot-related data

Data is taken from the WA State Liquor and Cannibus Board and the Washington Poison Center. The analysis looks at marijuana-related calls to the poison center as well as when and where retail pot-shops opened up in King County.
