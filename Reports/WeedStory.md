#Marijuana Exposures in King County
## October 3, 2015

The goal of this study was to determine any trends or correlations in recreational marijuana usage across Washington State (primarily King County) and to see what relationships, if any, exist between marijuana-related exposures (as-reported by the WAPC) and the opening of recreational pot shops. This required gathering data on when shops opened and where (Zip Code is the smallest common geographic indicator for the two datasets). The two datasets were merged based on Zip Code and analyzed for different trends. 

## Data Sources and Variables
- The data from this study came from two different sources
	- **Phone records of the Washington State Poison Center**
		- Date of exposure
		- County
		- City
		- Zip Code
		- Patient Age
		- Source
		- Severity
		- Followed-up 
	- **Recreational Shops** - Data gathered from various sources (Facebook, twitter, news articles)
		- Shop Name
		- Date Opened
		- Zip Code


From the following figure, we can see that the majority of marijuana exposures, that is, calls that come into the Washington State Poison Center that can be mainly attributed to marijuana usage, are from "Marijuana Plant" usage.

From the data, it is clear that the majority of pot shops are not located where the majority of exposures are reported. Pioneer Square and the U District have, by far, the greatest amount of reported cases. By contrast, the neighborhood with the most recreational pot shops is the Fremont/Walllingford neighborhood.
